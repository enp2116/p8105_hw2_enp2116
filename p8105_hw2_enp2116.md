# Problem 1

Read and clean the data; retain line, station, name, station latitude /
longitude, routes served, entry, vending, entrance type, and ADA
compliance. Convert the entry variable from character (YES vs NO) to a
logical variable (the ifelse or recode function may be useful).

Write a short paragraph about this dataset – explain briefly what
variables the dataset contains, describe your data cleaning steps so
far, and give the dimension (rows x columns) of the resulting dataset.
Are these data tidy?

Answer the following questions using these data:

-   How many distinct stations are there? Note that stations are
    identified both by name and by line (e.g. 125th St 8th Avenue; 125st
    Broadway; 125st Lenox); the distinct function may be useful here.

-   How many stations are ADA compliant?

-   What proportion of station entrances / exits without vending allow
    entrance?

Reformat data so that route number and route name are distinct
variables.

-   How many distinct stations serve the A train?
-   Of the stations that serve the A train, how many are ADA compliant?

# Problem 2

Read and clean the Mr. Trash Wheel sheet:

-   specify the sheet in the Excel file and to omit non-data entries
    (rows with notes / figures; columns containing notes) using
    arguments in read_excel
-   use reasonable variable names
-   omit rows that do not include dumpster-specific data round the
    number of sports balls to the nearest integer and converts the
    result to an integer variable (using as.integer)

Read and clean the Professor Trash Wheel sheet:

-   specify the sheet in the Excel file and to omit non-data entries
    (rows with notes / figures; columns containing notes) using
    arguments in read_excel
-   use reasonable variable names
-   omit rows that do not include dumpster-specific data round the
    number of sports balls to the nearest integer and converts the
    result to an integer variable (using as.integer)

Combine this with the Mr. Trash Wheel dataset to produce a single tidy
dataset. To keep track of which Trash Wheel is which, you may need to
add an additional variable to both datasets before combining.

Write a paragraph about these data; you are encouraged to use inline R.
Be sure to note the number of observations in the resulting dataset, and
give examples of key variables.

-   For available data, what was the total weight of trash collected by
    Professor Trash Wheel?
-   What was the total number of sports balls collected by Mr. Trash
    Wheel in 2020?

# Problem 3

In particular, we’ll use the data in pols-month.csv, unemployment.csv,
and snp.csv. Our goal is to merge these into a single data frame using
year and month as keys across datasets.

First, clean the data in pols-month.csv. Use separate() to break up the
variable mon into integer variables year, month, and day; replace month
number with month name; create a president variable taking values gop
and dem, and remove prez_dem and prez_gop; and remove the day variable.

Second, clean the data in snp.csv using a similar process to the above.
For consistency across datasets, arrange according to year and month,
and organize so that year and month are the leading columns.

Third, tidy the unemployment data so that it can be merged with the
previous datasets. This process will involve switching from “wide” to
“long” format; ensuring that key variables have the same name; and
ensuring that key variables take the same values.

Join the datasets by merging snp into pols, and merging unemployment
into the result.

Write a short paragraph about these datasets. Explain briefly what each
dataset contained, and describe the resulting dataset (e.g. give the
dimension, range of years, and names of key variables).

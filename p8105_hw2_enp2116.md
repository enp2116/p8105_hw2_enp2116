# Problem 1

Reading and cleaning the data; retaining line, station, name, station
latitude / longitude, routes served, entry (logical), vending, entrance
type, and ADA compliance:

``` r
nyc_transit_data =
  read_csv("./NYC_Transit_Subway_Entrance_And_Exit_Data.csv") %>%
  janitor::clean_names() %>%
  select(line:entry, vending, ada) %>%
  mutate(entry = recode(entry, "YES" = TRUE, "NO" = FALSE))
```

The cleaned NYC transit dataset contains the variables: line,
station_name, station_latitude, station_longitude, route1, route2,
route3, route4, route5, route6, route7, route8, route9, route10,
route11, entrance_type, entry, vending, ada. Thusfar, I have cleaned the
data by turning all variable names into lower- and camel-case, selecting
only the variables asked for, and recoding the entry variable as
logical. The `NYC Transit` dataset has 1868 rows and 19 columns,
indicating we have data on 1868 different entrances or exits and want to
look at 19 different traits in each of these. These data are not yet
tidy, as we have 11 “route” variables (for each of the routes offered at
a given entrance or exit), which can be condensed into two columns to be
tidy.

-   In this dataset, we have 465 distinct stations.

-   There are 468 ADA compliant stations.

-   The proportion of station entrances / exits without vending allow
    entrance is 0.0369379.

Reformatting dataset so that route number and route name are distinct
variables:

``` r
tidy_nyc_transit_data =
  read_csv("./NYC_Transit_Subway_Entrance_And_Exit_Data.csv") %>%
  janitor::clean_names() %>%
  select(line:entry, vending, ada) %>%
  pivot_longer(
    cols = contains('route'),
    names_to = "route_number",
    names_prefix = "route",
    values_to = "route_name",
    values_transform = list(route_name = as.character),
    values_drop_na = TRUE ) %>%
  mutate(entry = recode(entry, "YES" = TRUE, "NO" = FALSE))
```

-   How many distinct stations serve the A train?

<!-- -->

    ## [1] 56

-   Of the stations that serve the A train, how many are ADA compliant?

<!-- -->

    ## [1] 107

# Problem 2

Reading and cleaning the Mr. Trash Wheel sheet:

``` r
mr_trash_wheel =
  read_excel(
    "./Trash-Wheel-Collection-Totals-7-2020-2.xlsx",
    sheet = "Mr. Trash Wheel",
    range = "A2:N533") %>%
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  drop_na(dumpster) %>% 
  mutate(sports_balls = round(sports_balls, 0)) %>% 
  mutate(sports_balls = as.integer(sports_balls))
```

Reading and cleaning the Professor Trash Wheel sheet:

``` r
prof_trash_wheel =
  read_excel(
    "./Trash-Wheel-Collection-Totals-7-2020-2.xlsx",
    sheet = "Professor Trash Wheel",
    range = "A2:N115") %>%
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  drop_na(dumpster) %>% 
  mutate(sports_balls = round(sports_balls, 0)) %>% 
  mutate(sports_balls = as.integer(sports_balls))
```

Combining the Mr. Trash Wheel & Professor Trash Wheel datasets to
produce a single tidy dataset (tidy_trash_wheel):

``` r
mr_trash_wheel = 
  mutate(mr_trash_wheel, trash_wheel_type = "mr_trash_wheel")

prof_trash_wheel = 
  mutate(prof_trash_wheel, trash_wheel_type = "prof_trash_wheel")

tidy_trash_wheel = 
  bind_rows(mr_trash_wheel, prof_trash_wheel) %>%
  janitor::clean_names() 
```

The combined trash wheel dataset contains the variables: dumpster,
month, year, date, weight_tons, volume_cubic_yards, plastic_bottles,
polystyrene, cigarette_butts, glass_bottles, grocery_bags, chip_bags,
sports_balls, homes_powered, trash_wheel_type and has 524 total
observations. Data were collected from the two datasets: mr_trash_wheel,
prof_trash_wheel. The variable of weight_tons has values such as 4.31,
2.74, 3.45, 3.1, 4.06, 2.71 tons and sports_balls has values such as 7,
5, 6, 6, 7, 5, measuring the number of sports balls present in each
dumpster.

-   For available data, what was the total weight of trash collected by
    Professor Trash Wheel?

<!-- -->

    ## [1] 135.5

-   What was the total number of sports balls collected by Mr. Trash
    Wheel in 2020?

<!-- -->

    ## [1] 5321

# Problem 3

In particular, we’ll use the data in pols-month.csv, unemployment.csv,
and snp.csv. Our goal is to merge these into a single data frame using
year and month as keys across datasets.

First, clean the data in pols-month.csv. Use separate() to break up the
variable mon into integer variables year, month, and day; replace month
number with month name; create a president variable taking values gop
and dem, and remove prez_dem and prez_gop; and remove the day variable.

Second, clean the data in snp.csv using a similar process to the above.
For consistency across datasets, arrange according to year and month,
and organize so that year and month are the leading columns.

Third, tidy the unemployment data so that it can be merged with the
previous datasets. This process will involve switching from “wide” to
“long” format; ensuring that key variables have the same name; and
ensuring that key variables take the same values.

Join the datasets by merging snp into pols, and merging unemployment
into the result.

Write a short paragraph about these datasets. Explain briefly what each
dataset contained, and describe the resulting dataset (e.g. give the
dimension, range of years, and names of key variables).

# Problem 1

Reading and cleaning the data; retaining line, station, name, station
latitude / longitude, routes served, entry (logical), vending, entrance
type, and ADA compliance:

``` r
nyc_transit_data =
  read_csv("./NYC_Transit_Subway_Entrance_And_Exit_Data.csv", col_types = cols(Route8 = "c", Route9 = "c", Route10 = "c", Route11 = "c")) %>%
  janitor::clean_names() %>%
  select(line, station_name, station_latitude, station_longitude, 
    starts_with("route"), entry, exit_only, vending, entrance_type, 
    ada) %>%
  mutate(entry = recode(entry, "YES" = TRUE, "NO" = FALSE))
```

The cleaned NYC transit dataset contains the variables: line,
station_name, station_latitude, station_longitude, route1, route2,
route3, route4, route5, route6, route7, route8, route9, route10,
route11, entry, exit_only, vending, entrance_type, ada. Thusfar, I have
cleaned the data by turning all variable names into lower- and
camel-case, selecting only the variables asked for, and recoding the
entry variable as logical. The `NYC Transit` dataset has 1868 rows and
20 columns, indicating we have data on 1868 different entrances or exits
and want to look at 20 different traits in each of these. These data are
not yet tidy, as we have 11 “route” variables (for each of the routes
offered at a given entrance or exit), which can be condensed into two
columns to be tidy.

-   Distinct stations:

``` r
nyc_transit_data %>% 
  select(station_name, line) %>% 
  distinct %>% 
  nrow()
```

    ## [1] 465

-   ADA compliant stations:

``` r
nyc_transit_data %>% 
  filter(ada == TRUE) %>% 
  select(station_name, line) %>% 
  distinct %>% 
  nrow()
```

    ## [1] 84

-   The proportion of station entrances / exits without vending allow
    entrance:

``` r
nyc_transit_data %>% 
  filter(vending == "NO") %>% 
  pull(entry) %>% 
  mean
```

    ## [1] 0.3770492

Reformatting dataset so that route number and route name are distinct
variables:

``` r
  tidy_nyc_transit_data =
  nyc_transit_data %>% 
  pivot_longer(
    route1:route11,
    names_to = "route_num",
    values_to = "route_name")
```

-   How many distinct stations serve the A train?

    ## [1] 60

-   Of the stations that serve the A train, how many are ADA compliant?

# Problem 2

Reading and cleaning the Mr. Trash Wheel sheet:

``` r
mr_trash_wheel =
  read_excel(
    "./Trash Wheel Collection Data.xlsx",
    sheet = "Mr. Trash Wheel",
    range = "A2:N549") %>%
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  drop_na(dumpster) %>% 
  mutate(sports_balls = round(sports_balls, 0)) %>% 
  mutate(sports_balls = as.integer(sports_balls)) 
```

Reading and cleaning the Professor Trash Wheel sheet:

``` r
prof_trash_wheel =
  read_excel(
    "./Trash Wheel Collection Data.xlsx",
    sheet = "Professor Trash Wheel",
    range = "A2:M94") %>%
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  drop_na(dumpster) %>% 
  mutate(year = as.character(year))
```

Combining the Mr. Trash Wheel & Professor Trash Wheel datasets to
produce a single tidy dataset (tidy_trash_wheel):

``` r
mr_trash_wheel = 
  mutate(mr_trash_wheel, trash_wheel_type = "mr_trash_wheel")

prof_trash_wheel = 
  mutate(prof_trash_wheel, trash_wheel_type = "prof_trash_wheel")

tidy_trash_wheel = 
  bind_rows(mr_trash_wheel, prof_trash_wheel) %>%
  janitor::clean_names() 
```

The combined trash wheel dataset contains the variables: dumpster,
month, year, date, weight_tons, volume_cubic_yards, plastic_bottles,
polystyrene, cigarette_butts, glass_bottles, grocery_bags, chip_bags,
sports_balls, homes_powered, trash_wheel_type and has 639 total
observations. Data were collected from the two datasets: mr_trash_wheel,
prof_trash_wheel. The variable of weight_tons has values such as 4.31,
2.74, 3.45, 3.1, 4.06, 2.71 tons and sports_balls has values such as 7,
5, 6, 6, 7, 5, measuring the number of sports balls present in each
dumpster.

-   For available data, what was the total weight of trash collected by
    Professor Trash Wheel?

<!-- -->

    ## [1] 184.71

-   What was the total number of sports balls collected by Mr. Trash
    Wheel in 2020?

# Problem 3

Using the data in pols-month.csv, unemployment.csv, and snp.csv with the
goal to merge these into a single data frame using year and month as
keys across datasets.

Cleaning the data in pols-month.csv:

``` r
pols_month_data =
  read_csv("./fivethirtyeight_datasets/pols-month.csv") %>%
  janitor::clean_names() %>%
  separate(mon, into = c("year", "month", "day"), sep = "-") %>% 
  mutate(month = recode(month, "01" = "jan", "02" = "feb", "03" = "mar", "04" = "apr", "05" = "may", "06" = "jun", "07" = "jul", "08" = "aug", "09" = "sep", "10" = "oct", "11" = "nov", "12" = "dec")) %>% 
  mutate(
    president = case_when(prez_dem == 1 ~ 'dem',
                          prez_gop == 1 ~ 'gop')) %>% 
  select(-c(prez_dem, prez_gop, day))
```

-   Note: the variable of president shows up with NA values in the tidy
    dataset due to a 2 value occurring in prez_gop from august
    1974-december 1974, because President Gerald Ford was not elected
    into presidency but rather took over after Nixon. Dr. Goldsmith told
    us not to try to alter the data (change the 2s to 1s) but
    acknowledge the gap.

Second, cleaning the data in snp.csv using a similar process to the
above. For consistency across datasets, arranging according to year and
month, and organizing so that year and month are the leading columns:

``` r
snp_data =
  read_csv("./fivethirtyeight_datasets/snp.csv") %>%
  janitor::clean_names() %>%
  separate(date, into = c("month", "day", "year"), sep = "/") %>% 
  mutate(month = recode(month, "1" = "jan", "2" = "feb", "3" = "mar", "4" = "apr", "5" = "may", "6" = "jun", "7" = "jul", "8" = "aug", "9" = "sep", "10" = "oct", "11" = "nov", "12" = "dec")) %>% 
  relocate(year, month) %>% 
  arrange(year, month) %>% 
  mutate(
    year_prefix = case_when(year < 16 ~ 20,
                          year > 49 ~ 19)) %>% 
  mutate(year = paste(year_prefix, year, sep = "")) %>%
    select(-c(year_prefix, day))
```

Third, tidying the unemployment data so that it can be merged with the
previous datasets:

``` r
unemployment_data =
  read_csv("./fivethirtyeight_datasets/unemployment.csv") %>%
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  pivot_longer(
    jan:dec,
    names_to = "month", 
    values_to = "unemployment rate") %>% 
  mutate(
    year = as.character(year)
  )
```

Joining the datasets by merging snp into pols, and merging unemployment
into the result.

``` r
snp_pols_data = 
  left_join(pols_month_data, snp_data, by = c("year", "month"))

snp_pols_unemp_data = 
  left_join(snp_pols_data, unemployment_data, by = c("year", "month"))
```

The tidy `pols-month` dataset contained 822 rows and 9 columns, meaning
822 total observations and 9 variables measured. This dataset contained
information from years: 1947, 2015, including variables that measured
political standing across governors, senators, representatives, and
presidents for the given each month and year. Variables such as gov_dem
took values such as 23, 23, 23, 23, 23, 23 (representing the number of
democratic governors) and the variable of president took values of dem,
gop, NA.

The tidy `snp` dataset contained 787 rows and 3 columns, meaning 787
total observations and 3 variables measured. This dataset contained
information from years: 1950, 2015. The key variable here is close,
which measured the closing values of the S&P stock index on the
associated date. This variable took on values such as 1452.430054,
1517.680054, 1320.280029, 1366.420044, 1394.459961, 1430.829956.

The tidy `unemployment` dataset contained 816 rows and 3 columns,
meaning 816 total observations and 3 variables measured. This dataset
contained information from years: 1948, 2015. The key variable here is
the unemployment_rate, which took on values such as .

The resulting dataset, which was formed by merging the `pols-month`,
`snp`, and `unemployment` datasets using year and month as keys,
contained 822 rows and 11 columns, meaning 822 total observations and 11
variables measured. This dataset contained information from years: 1947,
2015 and looked at the variables of year, month, gov_gop, sen_gop,
rep_gop, gov_dem, sen_dem, rep_dem, president, close, unemployment rate.
